    <!-- Block-level elements are those that structure the main part of your 
     web page, by dividing your content into coherent blocks. 
     They always start on a new line and take up the full width of a page, 
     from left to right; they also can take up one line or multiple lines and have a line break before and after the element. -->

<!-- Inline elements are used to distinguish part of a text, to give it a particular function or meaning. 
Inline elements usually include a single or a few words.
They do not cause a line break and do not take up the full width of a page, only the space bounded by its opening and closing tag. 
The inline elements are usually used within other HTML elements.

Inline elements are: <a>, <abbr>, <acronym>, <b>, <bdo>, <big>, <br>, <button>, <cite>, <code>, <dfn>, <em>, <i>, <img>, <input>, <kbd>, <label>, <map>, <object>, <q>, <samp>, <script>, <select>, <small>, <span>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <textarea>, <time>, <tt> and <var>. -->
